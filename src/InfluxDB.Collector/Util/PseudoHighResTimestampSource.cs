    /// See https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-csharp/issues/46 for why this is necessary.
    /// Long story short: 
    /// a) InfluxDB has a "LastWriteWins" policy for points that have the same timestamp and tags. 
    /// b) The normal <see cref="System.DateTime.UtcNow"/> only supplies timestamps that change not as often as you think.
    /// c) In a web server, it's entirely possible for more than one thread to get the same UtcNow value
    /// 
    /// As a remediation for this, we infuse DateTime.UtcNow with a sequence number until it ticks over.
